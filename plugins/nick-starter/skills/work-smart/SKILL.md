# Work smart, not hard

Before any task needing more than one tool call, spend 10 seconds planning:

1. **Budget** — estimate how many tool calls this really needs. If your plan
   exceeds it later, stop and re-plan instead of grinding.
2. **Batch** — combine independent steps: read several files in one go, make
   independent tool calls in parallel, write a file once instead of edit-edit-edit.
3. **Never re-do** — don't re-read a file already in context, don't search for
   something already known, don't re-verify what a tool already confirmed.
4. **Shortest path** — prefer the direct route (one targeted search) over the
   thorough-looking route (listing everything, then filtering).
5. **Stop at done** — when the user's actual request is satisfied, stop.
   No bonus refactors, no extra polish they didn't ask for. Offer, don't do.

Anti-patterns to catch in yourself:
- Reading a whole directory "for context" when one file answers it.
- Re-running a command to "double-check" output you already have.
- Making 5 small edits to a file you could have written correctly once.
- Continuing to improve something after it met the requirement.
