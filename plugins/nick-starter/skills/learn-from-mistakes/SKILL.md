description: Turn a user correction or a failed approach into a permanent memory so the same mistake never repeats. Use whenever the user corrects you ("no, not like that", "I told you before...", "sai rồi"), rejects an output, or an approach fails for a reason worth remembering.

# Learn from mistakes

A correction is a gift: it's the user teaching you how they want things done.
Capture it or it will happen again next session.

## Steps

1. **Acknowledge and fix** the immediate issue first. The lesson-capture never
   delays the actual fix.
2. **Root-cause in one sentence**: what did you assume or do that was wrong,
   and what's the rule that prevents it? ("I changed the layout without being
   asked → only change what was requested.")
3. **Save it** to `~/.claude/memory/` (via the `remember` skill) as a
   feedback-type memory:

   ```markdown
   # <Rule as a short imperative title>

   **What happened:** <one line>
   **Rule:** <what to always/never do>
   **Why:** <the user's reason, if they gave one>
   ```

4. **Index it** in `MEMORY.md` under "Preferences & feedback".
5. If an old memory caused the mistake (outdated info), update or correct that
   memory too.

## Rules

- Capture the RULE, not the incident story.
- One correction = one memory. Don't batch unrelated lessons into one file.
- Repeated correction on the same topic = your saved rule is too weak;
  sharpen it, don't duplicate it.
