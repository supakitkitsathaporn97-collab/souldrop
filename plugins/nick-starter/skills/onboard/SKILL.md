name: onboard
description: Guided interview (Vietnamese or English) that creates the user's own personalized AI assistant — asks their name, goals, the assistant's name and personality, then writes ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md and a memory scaffold. Use when the user types /onboard, asks to "set up my assistant", "create my AI", "tạo trợ lý", "cài đặt trợ lý", or when they appear to be brand new with no personalized CLAUDE.md.

# Onboard — build the user's personal AI assistant

You are about to run a short, friendly interview and then **write real files** that
turn this generic Claude Code install into the user's own named, personalized
assistant with persistent memory.

Golden rules for this whole flow:

- **Never invent facts.** Only write what the user actually answered.
- **Never overwrite anything without explicit confirmation** (Step 1 handles this).
- Use the `AskUserQuestion` tool for every question that has natural options
  (max 4 options per question; free-text "Other" is added automatically).
- Keep it warm and simple — the user is very likely a complete beginner.
  No jargon. Never mention "CLAUDE.md" or "frontmatter" during the interview;
  say "your assistant's profile" instead.
- One question round at a time. Do not dump all questions at once.

## Step 0 — Language gate (ALWAYS FIRST)

Ask with `AskUserQuestion`:

> Question: "Bạn muốn dùng tiếng nào? / Which language would you like to use?"
> Options: "Tiếng Việt", "English"

**Every subsequent question, preview, and file you generate uses the chosen
language** (the generated profile is written in that language too, with the
instruction that the assistant replies in it by default). The examples below are
shown in English; translate them naturally — not word-for-word — when the user
picks Tiếng Việt.

## Step 1 — Safety check on existing setup

Check whether `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` already exists (home directory: `$HOME` on
Mac/Linux, `%USERPROFILE%` on Windows — resolve it, don't guess).

- If it does NOT exist → continue to Step 2.
- If it EXISTS → read it. Then ask with `AskUserQuestion`:
  - "You already have an assistant profile. What would you like to do?"
  - Options:
    1. **Start fresh (keep a backup)** — back up the old file to
       `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md.backup-YYYY-MM-DD-HHmm` first, then replace it.
    2. **Update it** — run the interview, then merge: keep any custom sections
       the user added, replace the identity/personality/goals sections.
    3. **Cancel** — stop, change nothing, tell them how to re-run (`/onboard`).
- Never delete the old file. Backups always.

## Step 2 — The interview

Run these rounds with `AskUserQuestion`, in order. `AskUserQuestion` supports up
to 4 questions per call — group them as shown (2 calls + 1 free-text ask), so the
interview feels quick, not like a form.

**Round A — about the user** (one AskUserQuestion call, 2 questions):

1. *Your name* — has no natural options, so ask it as plain free text BEFORE the
   call, or as an "Other"-driven question with example options. Prefer plain
   conversation: "First — what should your assistant call you?"
2. *What do you mainly want help with?* (multiSelect: true)
   - Options: "Work & documents", "Content & social media", "Coding & tech",
     "Study & research" (+ Other for anything else, e.g. business, personal life)
3. *How should your assistant talk to you?*
   - Options: "Short & direct", "Friendly & warm", "Professional & formal",
     "Playful & fun"

**Round B — about the assistant** (free text + one AskUserQuestion call):

4. *Name your assistant* — plain free text: "Now the fun part — give your
   assistant a name. Anything you like." If they can't decide, offer 3 varied
   suggestions but never pick for them.
5. *Main jobs* (multiSelect: true) — "What should NAME own as its main jobs?"
   - Options tailored from their Round A answers, e.g.: "Draft & polish writing",
     "Research & summarize", "Organize files & plans", "Debug & explain code"
6. *Reply language* —
   - Options: "Tiếng Việt", "English", "Match whatever language I write in"

If any answer is unclear, ask one short follow-up. Do not re-ask what they
already told you.

## Step 3 — Generate the files

Read the template at `templates/CLAUDE.md.tmpl` (relative to this skill's
directory) and fill every `{{placeholder}}` from the interview answers. Rules:

- Write the profile in the user's interview language.
- Personality section must reflect their communication choice with 3-4 concrete
  behavioral lines (e.g. "Short & direct" → "Concise by default. No filler, no
  flattery. Expand only when asked.").
- Capabilities section lists ONLY the jobs they selected, one line each with a
  concrete example of how the assistant helps.
- Do not add capabilities, rules, or personality traits they didn't ask for.

Write these files:

1. `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` — the filled profile (respecting the Step 1 choice:
   fresh-with-backup, or merge).
2. `~/.claude/memory/MEMORY.md` — from `templates/MEMORY.md.tmpl`. If it already
   exists, leave it alone and only append the new index line from step 3.
3. `~/.claude/memory/about-me.md` — the first real memory: a short file recording
   the interview answers (their name, goals, preferences, assistant name, date).
   Add one index line for it to `MEMORY.md`.

## Step 4 — Preview & confirm

BEFORE writing `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, show the user a short preview:
the assistant's name, personality summary, its main jobs, and reply language —
in plain words, not raw file contents (offer to show the full file if they want).

Ask with `AskUserQuestion`: "Shall I save this?" — Options: "Yes, save it",
"Change something" (loop back to just the part they want changed), "Cancel".

Only write files after "Yes".

## Step 5 — First hello

After saving, greet the user **as their new assistant, by its new name, in their
chosen language, in its chosen personality**. Example shape (adapt, don't copy):

> "Xin chào Minh, mình là Linh 👋 Từ giờ mình là trợ lý riêng của bạn.
> Mình sẽ giúp bạn viết nội dung và tóm tắt tài liệu. Cứ nói chuyện với mình
> như bình thường — mình nhớ được những gì quan trọng. Bắt đầu nhé?"

Then tell them, briefly:
- The new personality fully activates next time they start `claude`
  (this session already behaves like it from now on).
- They can re-run `/onboard` anytime to change anything — nothing is ever lost,
  old profiles are backed up.
- Useful starter commands: `/remember` (save a fact), `/recall` (find one),
  `/daily-note` (journal today).

## Re-running

This skill is fully re-runnable. On any re-run, Step 1's existing-file check is
mandatory — never assume the previous run's state.
